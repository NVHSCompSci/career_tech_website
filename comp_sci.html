                    <b>First Year: </b>
                    In the first year of Computer Science, you will learn the basics of web design and take AP Computer Science Principles (APCSP) in JavaScript.
                    <br>
                    <b>Second Year: </b>
                    In your second year of Computer Science, you will learn Web Development which involves HTML and CSS combined and then Cybersecurity which is divided into two period blocks for each respectively.

                <p>
                    There are many benefits in taking Computer Science such as learning a variety of different coding languages, thinking critically, and you get to have a chance to explore and figure out your passion in computer science within the parameters of the class.

                <p>
                    There are no required prerequisites for enrolling into Computer Science. It is however suggested to take "Intro to Programming" class (not required) and to be comfortable with basic math functions and being able to graph on a basic x and y graph.
                </p>
            </div>

                <p>
                    Currently, there are no college credits past the AP Computer Science Principles in JavaScript.

                <p>
                    For every career tech program offered at Northview, two years of commitment is expected. For Computer Science, it is a double block class for the full academic year, for two years. Overall, the workload in the class is mostly well paced with the ability to easily catch up if falling behind.

                <p>While there are internships planned for the future, at the moment there are none available. In the classroom, students do hands-on projects such as making their own websites, collaborations between other classes, and building things to interact with the students' code such as Raspberry Pi projects for every student.</p>
