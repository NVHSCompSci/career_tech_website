              <h3>About our Teachers</h3>
              <p>After graduating from Northview High School, Mr. Sayre decided to return and continue his educational journey right where it all began. He initially intended to pursue a career as a social studies teacher after graduation, but he took a different path. Coaching college basketball. His dedication and passion for education, however, led him to pursue further academic achievements, obtaining an MBA with the financial support of Northview.
                Alongside Mr. Sayre, Mrs. Martin currently teaches at Northview. Mrs. Martin, equipped with a master's in education and a background in teaching business, complements Mr. Sayre's expertise. Both educators are qualified to teach College Credit Plus (CCP) classes, utilizing Mrs. Martin's master's in education and Mr. Sayre's master's in business. Together, they contribute to the academic enrichment of Northview, bringing a wealth of knowledge and experience to the students they instruct. </p>
