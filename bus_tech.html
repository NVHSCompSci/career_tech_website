              <h3>About our Teachers</h3>
              <p>After graduating from Northview High School, Mr. Sayre decided to return and continue his educational journey right where it all began. He initially intended to pursue a career as a social studies teacher after graduation, but he took a different path. Coaching college basketball. His dedication and passion for education, however, led him to pursue further academic achievements, obtaining an MBA with the financial support of Northview.
                Alongside Mr. Sayre, Mrs. Martin currently teaches at Northview. Mrs. Martin, equipped with a master's in education and a background in teaching business, complements Mr. Sayre's expertise. Both educators are qualified to teach College Credit Plus (CCP) classes, utilizing Mrs. Martin's master's in education and Mr. Sayre's master's in business. Together, they contribute to the academic enrichment of Northview, bringing a wealth of knowledge and experience to the students they instruct. </p>

          <h3>College Credit Opportunities</h3>
          <p>One standout feature of the Interactive Media program is the opportunity to earn college credits through the Career Technical Credit Transfer program. By successfully completing courses in Electronic Publishing, Digital Video Production, Raster Graphics, and Internet & Web Languages, students not only gain practical, hands-on skills but also accrue college credit. This not only accelerates their progress in higher education but also provides a tangible advantage as they embark on their academic and professional journeys. The ability to earn college credits while still in high school is a significant benefit, offering students a head start in their pursuit of a media-related education and career.</p>
